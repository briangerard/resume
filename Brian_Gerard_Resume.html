<strong>Summary</strong>

<p> I am a senior technical leader with a diverse repertoire and strong focus
on security and automation. My passion is bringing my skills to bear automating
the defense of websites and their users. I also enjoy training and mentorship,
and have spoken at conferences and user groups, developed and delivered
technical training, and led workshops.</p>

<p>18 years in system administration, 10 years in information security (largely
focused on abuse prevention), and 7 years in software engineering enable me to
bring a uniquely holistic approach to the solutions I create, incorporating the
best practices from multiple disciplines and delivering products which are
robust, performant, and maintainable.  Since I readily engage with people
across all levels of the organization, I can deliver a project from
design/proposal, through management buy-in, all the way to implementation and
deployment.</p>

<p>
<span class="company">Webassign, Inc.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="duration">(2013-Present)</span><br>
<span class="title">Senior Software Engineer</span><br>

I designed, architected, and developed the initial revision of the system which
now deploys the next generation of WebAssign's application into our
development, QA, and production environments.  I also led the Platform
Engineering team through the next several revisions of the system, expanding
and abstracting its capabilities.  The system is written using a combination of
Ansible and scripting (Perl/shell), driven from the command line, from Jenkins,
and via a graphical interface using AngularJS fronting Ruby on Rails.</p>

Concurrently serving as Security Steward for the company; in this role:
<ul>

    <li> Found and fixed a number of application security holes in our
    products.</li>

    <li> Provided architectural guidance and code reviews to the engineering
    teams.</li>

    <li> Kept upper management apprised of the latest relevant security
    bulletins, CVE's, etc, and fixed and/or supervised the teams who fixed
    emergent vulnerabilities (among them, HeartBleed and ShellShock).</li>

</ul>

<p>
Other projects include:
<ul>

    <li> Developed an in-house monitoring solution for our development and QA
    systems, filling visibility gaps in the main system until a final
    monitoring solution can be deployed.</li>

    <li> Created and delivered a class on Bash scripting and command line usage
    to the Engineering organization.  I have since delivered that training (and
    led a follow-on half day workshop) to the Triangle Linux Users Group.
    Slides and other materials are available at:

<span class="company">Yahoo!, Inc.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="duration">(2005-2013)</span><br>
<dl>
    <dt><span class="title">Abuse Software Engineer</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span class="duration">(2008-2013)</span></dt>

    <dd>
    While continuing to train new Abuse Defense team members, I developed three
    separate training courses on the abuse defense frameworks at Yahoo!  and
    delivered them on a quarterly basis to engineers from across the company.
    These were made a part of the standard on-boarding curriculum for new
    engineering hires.  I presented at internal and external conferences,
    arranged speakers for Yahoo!'s annual Security Week, and represented Yahoo!
    for recruiting at college events.

    <p>Working with another engineer on the team, we data mined logs from a
    major botnet attack against multiple Yahoo! properties and discovered novel
    characteristics of the traffic.  Using these results, we designed and built
    a new botnet defense system.  Using similar techniques, I delved into our
    CAPTCHA data on the Hadoop grid and developed a new defense against a
    previously unknown attack vector.</p>

    Leadership roles:
    <ul>

        <li>Initiated the program to architect our new abuse defense
        framework, and designed, contributed to, or consulted on almost every
        component of the systems that now make it up.</li>

        <li> Created the Statement of Work and served as Technical Laison for a
        major rewrite project we outsourced to a contracting firm in
        India.</li>

        <li> Managed the sustaining engineering (SWAT) group within the Abuse
        Engineering organization, leading the development sprints, hiring new
        team members,and defining the direction for the group.</li>
    
        <li> Coordinated abuse defense integration across all participating
        properties for World IPv6 Day (2011/06/08) and World IPv6 Launch Day
        (2012/06/06).  While managing the development, testing, and deployment
        of the updated platforms, I worked with teams across the company to
        ensure we were ready when the world went live.</p>
    </ul>

    </dd>

    <dt><span class="title">Abuse Defense Specialist</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span class="duration">(2005-2008)</span></dt>

    <dd>I designed, tuned, and coordinated the deployment of abuse defenses for
    many of Yahoo!'s premier properties, including Mail, Finance, Ad Systems,
    Answers, and Shopping.  I wrote custom Perl scripts to handle the data
    analysis needed for effective design, and directly interfaced Perl with our
    internal tool suite, enabling us to further customize the defenses.

    <p>As the technical lead for the team, I trained all new hires and provided
    ongoing mentorship on the more complex issues and attacks that we handled.
    I implemented several of the subsystems in our abuse feedback tracking
    system and account deactivation system, allowing Yahoo! properties to
    automatically disable abusive accounts as needed.  I wrote tools that the
    team still uses to effectively analyze operational issues.</p>

    <p>I took over custodianship of Yahoo!'s internal network database
    (dbm-based) and brought the build time down, from days to under an hour, by
    automating many of the data modifications and complex cross checks between
    the diverse sources that had been handled manually; such as security level
    validation and subnet overlap detection and splitting.  I organized the
    interdepartmental team and drove the project which migrated custodianship
    of this critical system to its current owners.</p>

<span class="company">Mirapoint, Inc.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="duration">(2004-2005)</span><br>
<span class="title">Senior Technical Support Engineer</span><br>
In addition to system analysis and live online troubleshooting of customer
production servers, I created scripts to manage and analyze the large volumes
of incoming system diagnostic data.  This allowed us an enterprise wide view of
customers' Mirapoint systems (dedicated FreeBSD-based email appliances), which
in turn provided a means of proactive troubleshooting and sizing
prediction.</p>

<p>I was entrusted with administrative login access to customers' live
production servers via proprietary configuration interface and shell access.
The debugging process included process tracing, and log, network, and core dump
analysis, and required deep knowledge of TCP/IP, SMTP, LDAP, IMAP, and DNS.</p>

<span class="company">Neoforma, Inc.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="duration">(2002 - 2004)</span><br>
<span class="title">Unix System Administrator</span><br>

I was Operations Lead on a range of projects, including the migration of our
SAN and NAS from EMC to HDS, multi-domain NIS/netgroup setup in three
datacenters, engineering Perl-based failover solutions (LAN and WAN) for
various suites of applications, and writing a centralized log rotation and
archival system for a variety of servers.  I led three to six engineering
projects annually, and fostered interdepartmental cooperation between the
Engineering, DBA, System Administration, and Production Support teams.  I
documented and led the final deployment of those projects into the production
environment.</p>

<p> I managed multiple Veritas clusters (VCS 3.5), Linux DNS and sendmail
servers, and a variety of networking equipment (Cisco 5500/6500 switches, PIX
firewalls, and 25XX/26XX routers).  I administered our SAN (first EMC/McData,
then HDS/Brocade) and NAS (first EMC Celerra, then Veritas clustered Sun 420Rs;
a NetApp Filer throughout), and managed NIS for 3 sites and 120+ servers with
over 3000 users.  </p>

  presence on several occasions, meeting Neoforma's challenges as they arose.
  </dd>

 <dt><span class="client">Digex, Inc.</span></dt>

  <dd> I was solely responsible for the IT needs of three west coast
  facilities.  I managed everything from desktop phones (punchdown through
  switch configuration), to NT domain administration, desktop builds, and
  network troubleshooting (on the switch, and NT and Solaris workstations).  I
  brought the IT inventory under control, coordinated with east coast
  headquarters on a daily basis, and interviewed, hired, and trained a full
  time employee to replace me at the end of the contract.</dd>
